Abstract:
Machine vision and automatic control are highly significant and widely explored domains in 
the field of electronic engineering. They have emerged as crucial components for numerous 
applications across various industries. This project presents the design of an autonomous 
line-following and obstacle-avoiding rover, utilizing the OpenMV as the main control chip for 
visual recognition and autonomous driving, complemented by the STM32 (L432K) 
microcontroller to enable a series of distinctive behaviors. The rover is equipped with modules 
such as ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders, motor drivers, and wireless communication, 
enabling a wide range of intelligent functionalities. The robot integrates path tracking, 
obstacle avoidance, shape recognition, wireless communication, and projectile capabilities 
into a compact PCB-based hardware platform. It exhibits high integration, stability, small form 
factor, reliability, strong anti-interference ability, and user-friendly operation. The hardware 
design includes the integration of these modules and the software design encompasses the 
development of algorithms for vision processing, motion control, and communication. This 
paper provides a detailed description of the hardware and software design processes, 
highlighting the unique advantages of the system. Experimental results demonstrate the 
effectiveness and performance of the developed autonomous rover.
